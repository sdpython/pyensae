    I recently faced some issues with
    method `read_csv <http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.read_csv.html>`_
    which could not read my text file. There was an issue with a null
    character. So I revisited some old code I wrote long time
    ago about guessing the schema of a text file:
    :func:`TextFileColumns <pyensae.sql.file_text_binary_columns.TextFileColumns>`::
    
        f = TextFileColumns(filename)
        f.open()
        for row in f:
            print(row)
        f.close()    
        
    Each row is given as a dictionary::
    
        {'Adj_Close': 5.95, 'High': 6.04, 'Open': 5.99, 'Low': 5.92, 'Volume': 5426200, 'Close': 5.95, 'Date': '2012-12-14'}
        
    The function guess the column types based on the first rows. It also
    guesses the column separator.
