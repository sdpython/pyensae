    Module `qgrid <https://github.com/quantopian/qgrid>`_ proposes a nice view of a dataframe
    inside a notebook: :ref:`usingqgridwithjsdfrst`. The javascript
    object allow sorting and scrolling in a much nicer way than
    the regular output of a dataframe in a notebook.
    
    The javascript can be used remotely or locally. In the first case,
    the javascript must be taken care of while converting
    the notebook into a HTML page.
